<div style="font-size:1.2rem;">
sdmx.io is a community of organisations and open source projects collaborating and coordinating activity to deliver an integrated ecosystem of software tools for official statistics use cases.
</div>

sdmx.io is therefore not a single project, but a collection of separate but interoperable software tools from different teams and organisations.

The community is founded on four key principles:
- **public goods** - development of free and open source software to improve the production and publication of timely, accurate and granular official statistics
- **consensus** - decision by agreement 
- **collaboration** - a commitment to work together to achieve the sdmx.io goal
- **coordination** - maximise what can be delivered within the budget / capacity available by avoiding duplication of effort

The tools are centered around the SDMX[^1] ISO 17369 international standard for the exchange of statistical data and metadata. 

# The sdmx.io goal
<div class="alert alert-primary pb-4 pt-4 text-center" role="alert">
A cooperating ecosystem of high quality open source software tools that satisfy the needs of the complete range of official statistics organisations.
</div>


sdmx.io was borne from analysis in 2021 that identified a number of weaknesses and opportunities in the SDMX and official statistics software tool landscape.

1. Some user needs are not being met, in particular those of organisations without in-depth experience of the SDMX standard, often those in the least developed and developing countries. Many open source tools are produced by the most sophisticated organisations which are necessarily focused on meeting their own needs. For many, tools are required which reduce the barrier to entry by minimising the amount of expert SDMX knowledge required to operate.
2. The drive to satisfy user requirements is hampered by an incomplete understanding of what they actually need. 
3. Insufficient coordination between tools producers has resulted in several competing tools serving the same purpose while other use cases go unsatisfied. Budget is limited. Avoiding this duplication of effort releases funding to provide better coverage of user needs.
4. Much has been invested by the SDMX Sponsors[^2] in developing the standard since its inception in 2005. However, the global benefits of SDMX in terms of improved social, economic and environmental outcomes can only be realised if widely adopted and used. High quality, affordable software tools that are simple to use and do what users want promote adoption by removing barriers and providing organisations with a practical way to embrace the standard.
